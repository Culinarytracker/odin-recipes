        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>A quick and easy Salmon dish with a zangy lemon and caper butter sauce.</p>
        <p>This salmon can be made either sauteed or grilled, but the sauce works better when sauteed in my option because you get to deglaze the 
            salmon fond from the pan. I prefer to let the capers fry up a bit before deglazing with the lemon juice. Also the butter should be added so there is just enough 
            heat to get it all melted and well emulsified.
        </p>
